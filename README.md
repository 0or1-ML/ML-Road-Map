# ML Road Map


Milestones:
You should divide your learning path into 4 stages: 
    1. sponge mode;
    2. the stage of deepening; 
    3. targeted practice;
    4. the era of specialization.


#### Sponge Mode 

During Sponge Mode, you learn the whole general theory superficially, for example: using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Also, practice each new topic on mini-projects or programs.

***Output:** you have a big picture of ML, with theoretical and practical skills.*



#### The Stage of Deepening

In this mode, delve into each of the 13 core principles of ML, for example: if there is an algorithm for the classification of k-nearest neighborhoods, then write this algorithm ourselves and make a project on it.

***Output:** know how to customize the available libraries for our project, know where to tune up in order to change certain parameters of ML algorithm.*


#### Targeted Practice 

At this stage, make different kind of projects. During the implementation of the project, you will learn at the same time, as places where there are gaps in knowledge will appear.

***Output:** more practical knowledge.*


#### The Era of Specialization

There are many specializations in ML and you won't have enough time to cover them up all. Specializations: computer vision, language analysis, stock market analysis, recommendation system, etc. At this stage, choose your own specialization. 

***Output:** specialization in one area.*

### Python
![Python](https://telegra.ph/file/b0c3c568f0808da9d0776.png)


Python is the base of everything. You should learn in order to have an understanding of base concepts of AI libraries. But you should not spend much time on it, just proceed to the next step as you feel a little confidence on the language and have understanding of OOP.

    Variables
    Mathematical Operators
    Control Statements
    Data Structures (List, Set, Dict, etc.)
    Work with files
    Functions
    Object-Oriented Programming

### Numpy & Pandas
![Numpy&Pandas](https://telegra.ph/file/7cbab836e85d6101ded66.png)

As you will create your ML-algorithms the most of your time you will spend collecting, cleaning and storing data. When you want to manipulate your data and deal with that you should know Numpy and Pandas. They are two strong python libraries. Numpy helps you to work with numerical data. Compute any statistics criteria also includes many functions for linear algebra. Pandas help you to extract many important points and statistics in your data. It keeps your data as a DataFrame which is so strong to see any fact in your data. You can learn about these libraries by their documentation or by taking courses. You should be familiar with the following concepts:

    -Read Data
    -Compute Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, Median, Mode, etc.
    -Compute Correlation and Correlation Matrix
    -Matrix Multiplication
    -Inverse of Matrix
    -Work with Matrix
    -Group your data
    -Fill NaN & Null Value

### Data Visualization Libraries
![Matplotlib](https://telegra.ph/file/5dbaadacb5ff21de03c79.jpg)

You can extract many important facts about your data with Pandas and Numpy. But, if you want to show them to people or companies you should use plots and graphs. Many kinds of plots are available in Matplotlib and Seaborn. You should implement the following concepts:

    -Histogram
    -Stacked Histogram
    -Bar Chart
    -Scatter Plot
    -Box Plot
    -3D Plot
    -KDE Plot
    -Swarm plot
    -Heatmap
    -Distribution Plot
    -Custom your plots
